# 💓 Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning

Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Early detection through data-driven systems can significantly help in preventing severe outcomes. This project leverages **Machine Learning** to predict the presence of heart disease based on patient health metrics.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This web app allows users to input medical parameters and receive predictions about heart disease risk using various **machine learning algorithms**.

The application is built using:
- **Python**
- **Streamlit**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Keras**
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**

### 🧠 Algorithms Implemented

- Logistic Regression  
- Naive Bayes  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
- Decision Tree  
- Random Forest  
- XGBoost  
- Artificial Neural Network (Keras, 1 Hidden Layer)
